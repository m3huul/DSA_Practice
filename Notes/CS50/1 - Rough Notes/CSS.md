CSS or Cascading Style Sheets, is a programming language used to decorate a webpage. Its used to change the looks of everything you can see on a webpage. For example to add colour, change text size, or changing a grid/layout on a webpage.

There are multiple ways to add css in our HTML we will go over them one by one while going over some css:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>home</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p> John Harvard </p>
		<p> Welcome to my page! </p>
		<p> Copyright (c) John Harvard 1636 </p>
	</body>
</html>
```
Lets take this as an example,

## Font Size
All the paragraphs here will be laid out one by one which does not separate them, So we can change it like this:
``<p style="font-size: large;"> John Harvard </p>``
``<p style="font-size: medium;"> John Harvard </p>``
``<p style="font-size: small;"> John Harvard </p>``

As the name suggests it will change the paragraphs text size.

## Text-Align
``<p style="font-size: small; text-align: center;"> John Harvard </p>``

This will align the text to the centre of the page
