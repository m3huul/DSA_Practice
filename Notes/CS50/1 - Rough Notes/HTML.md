- Its not a programming language, meaning it does not contains methods or variables.

- HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) : It has main two features:
	- tags
	- attributes
	
- Taking an example HTML code:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>
			Hello, title
		</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		hello, body
	</body>
</html>
```
Now we can use a server (A server is just a software running on a machine, whose purpose in life is to just handle requests and serve data) to host this html page.
